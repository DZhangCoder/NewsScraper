# News Scraper
News Scraper is a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news.

Whenever a user visits the site, the app will scrape stories from Wall Street Journal and display them for the user. Each scraped article will be saved to the application database (MongoDB).

Users are able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments will be saved to the database as well and associated with their articles. Users can also delete comments left on articles. All stored comments will be visible to every user.
